Script to surrender farm in Bloons TD Battles 2.

Windowed mode required, the script will set the game's resolution to what it expects. Places first tower and surrenders 3 seconds after. Does not support water towers. Restarts game every 50 rounds to reduce lag that I've found accumulates after time; the script expects a default install location but can be changed on line 132.
